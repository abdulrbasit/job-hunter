# Onboard — Agent Mode

Full interactive setup for agent mode. Runs config → career context → story bank → base resume in one session.

**Rules:**
- One topic at a time. Wait for the user's answer before moving on.
- Flag any template placeholder values — never treat them as configured.
- Derive country code from city; confirm before using it.

---

## Before You Start

Read `config/job_hunter.yml`. Note any fields still at template defaults (`Your City`, empty `job_titles`, etc.).

---

## Step 1 — Job Titles

Show current titles. Flag if they are still template defaults.

Ask:

> What job titles should I search for? List all variations — the more specific, the better.
>
> Examples: `Senior Product Manager`, `Head of Product`, `Director of Product`
>
> List them one per line or comma-separated.

Replace `job_titles` with the user's list.

---

## Step 2 — Primary Region

Check if `regions.primary.location` is still `"Your City"`. If so, tell the user it must be set.

Ask:

> What city or region are you job hunting in?
> Examples: `Berlin`, `London`, `Amsterdam`, `Munich`, `Remote`

Derive the ISO alpha-2 country code from the city name (Munich→DE, London→GB, Amsterdam→NL, Paris→FR, Zurich→CH, Vienna→AT, Stockholm→SE, Oslo→NO, Copenhagen→DK, Warsaw→PL, Prague→CZ, Dublin→IE, Brussels→BE, Madrid→ES, Milan→IT, Toronto→CA, Sydney→AU, New York→US, San Francisco→US, Dubai→AE, Bangalore→IN, Singapore→SG, Tokyo→JP, Seoul→KR, São Paulo→BR). For cities not in this list, ask for the country code explicitly.

Show the derived code: `I'll use country code XX — correct? (Enter to confirm or type the right code)`

Then ask:

> Should searches use English only, or also the local language?
> Default `en` (English only). Type a language code to add local-language results (e.g., `de` for German).

Update `regions.primary` (keep `enabled: true`, `primary: true`, set `mode: agent`).

Then ask:

> Any other search regions? (Optional — add more later with `/setup region add`)

If yes, repeat city → code → language for each. Use the city name (lowercased, underscores) as the YAML key.

---

## Step 3 — Experience Levels

Ask:

> Which experience level(s) are you targeting? Postings are screened deterministically:
> if the required experience stated in a listing (years or seniority title) doesn't
> overlap any level you pick, it's excluded automatically — on top of whatever you set
> in the next step.
>
> Levels: student_intern, student_working_student, student_thesis, entry, junior,
> associate, mid, senior, lead, staff, principal, expert, manager, director, vp, c_level
>
> Reply with one or more level ids (comma-separated), or press Enter for
> `associate, mid, senior`.

Set `filters.experience_levels` to the chosen list of level ids.

---

## Step 4 — Exclusions

Read the *actual current* values from `exclusions.*` in the config you loaded in
"Before You Start" — the template ships all four empty (`[]`). Show them as read,
substituting `(none)` for any empty list. Do not invent or assume example values.

```
Current exclusions — edit anything or press Enter to keep as-is:

Title terms to skip:  [actual title_terms, or "(none)"]
Languages to exclude: [actual languages, or "(none)"]
Companies to skip:    [actual companies, or "(none)"]
Industries to skip:   [actual industries, or "(none)"]
```

These are on top of the experience-level screening from Step 3 — a posting requiring
10+ years is already excluded if you only selected entry/junior levels; you don't
need to add "senior" here separately.

Ask:

> Any changes? Examples: "add consulting to industries", "exclude language German".
> Press Enter to keep all defaults.

Apply any changes to the four `exclusions.*` fields.

---

## Step 5 — Quick Settings

Show all at once:

```
Quick settings — press Enter to keep defaults or type changes:

Resume layout:               double column  (alt: single column)
Profile photo:               none           (provide filename if you have one in profile/)
Min fit score:               70 / 100
Max years experience req'd:  (auto, from your selected experience levels — leave blank, or enter a number to override)
Batch size:                  15
```

Ask: `Any changes?`

Update:
- `profile.resume_tex`: `profile/resume_double_column.tex` or `profile/resume_single_column.tex`
- `profile.profile_image`: path or `""`
- `scoring.min_fit_score`, `scoring.batch_size`
- `scoring.max_years_experience_required` — only set this if the user gives an explicit
  number; otherwise leave it unset in the config so it defaults to the Step 3 career
  stage's own cap (student=1, early_career=3, experienced=8, leadership=none).

---

## Step 6 — API Keys

Tell the user:

> **Agent mode does not require LLM API keys** — Claude Code or Codex handles scoring and tailoring.
>
> To enable optional features (job board APIs for more results):
> 1. `cp .env.example .env`
> 2. Open `.env` and add any keys you have (Adzuna, Reed).
> 3. Leave unused keys blank — sources without keys are skipped silently.
>
> No LLM API key is needed for the core workflow.

No config changes here. Continue when ready.

---

## Step 7 — Config Preview and Write

Set `mode: agent` in the config.

Show the full updated `config/job_hunter.yml` preview:

```
Here is the config I will write:

[full file content]

Ready to write? (yes/no)
```

After confirmation, write the file.

---

## Step 8 — Health Check

Run:

```bash
job-hunter doctor --json
```

Parse and display results in a compact table (✓ pass / ✗ fail with fix hint). If anything is red that blocks the first run, help the user fix it before continuing.

---

## Step 9 — Career Context

Tell the user:

> Config saved. Now let's build your career profile — this is what the pipeline uses to score, tailor, and write cover letters accurately.
>
> Starting with career context…

Execute `.claude/skills/setup/modes/context.md` inline.

---

## Step 10 — Story Bank

Tell the user:

> Career context saved. Now let's capture your STAR stories — reusable proof points the tailoring step references.

Execute `.claude/skills/setup/modes/stories.md` inline.

---

## Step 11 — Base Resume

Tell the user:

> Stories saved. Now building your base LaTeX resume from your context and stories.

Execute `.claude/skills/setup/modes/resume.md` inline.

---

## Step 12 — Done

Tell the user:

> Setup complete. Run your first hunt:
>
> ```bash
> job-hunter hunt --region primary
> ```
>
> Then open Claude Code or Codex in this workspace and run `/job-hunter batch` to review and tailor candidates.
